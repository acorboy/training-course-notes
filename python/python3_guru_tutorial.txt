#Comments
		
The name of a variable or method is called - Identifier

Identifiers
	1. Start with letter or "_".  NOT DIGITS
	2. Letters, digits, and "_" are ok
	3. Any length
	4. No key words like:
		False      class      finally    is         return
		None       continue   for        lambda     try
		True       def        from       nonlocal   while
		and        del        global     not        with
		as         elif       if         or         yield
		pass       else       import     assert
		break      except     in         raise
	
Variables
	Everything is an object, even primitives like int, float, string
	
	Don't need to declare type
	
	x = 100 # x stores a reference to the 100 which is actually an int object
	
	Simultaneous Assignment
		var1, var2, var3 = exp1, exp2, exp3
		Do all that variable assignment in 1 line.
		
		Helpful for switching values
			x,y = y,x
		
Data Types
	Numbers
	String
	List
	Tuple
	Dictionary
	Boolean (literals)
		False:
		0 – zero , 0.0 ,
		[] – empty list , () – empty tuple , {} – empty dictionary ,  ”
		None <keyword>
		
Input from Console
	input() - always returns a string
		string to number - int() or eval()
	
	>>>age = input("Enter your age: " )
	Enter your age: 31
	>>>age
	'31'
	>>>type(age)
	<class 'str>
	>>>age = eval(age)
	>>>age
	31
	>>>type(age)
	<class 'int'>
	
Import Modules
	import module_name1, method_name2, ...
	
	>>>import math
	>>>math.pi
	3.141592653589793
