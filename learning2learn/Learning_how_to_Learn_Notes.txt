Learning to Learn

Focused & Diffuse
	Focused - Concentrating intently
	Diffuse - related to nueral resting states
			- Looking at things very boardly
	Can't be in both modes at the same time
	
	Diffuse - let your mind wander around
	
	Both - Go back an forth between modes
	A little everyday!
	It takes time.
  ** I Diffuse a lot and often.  I need to fidget to focus.  Stress balls, spinners, etc. **
  
What is Learning?

Coursera - Lets you switch to a new session

Procrastination
	Pomodoro technique
	25 minutes of technique + Reward
		Reward - videos, gum, drink, play with Lucas
	Then diffuse it
	
Practice Makes Permanent
	Practice ideas to build neural pathways
	A little every day with focus then diffusion
	Pomodoro

Intro to Memory
	Long term vs Working Memory
	Working - 	Consciously processing
			-	Holds about 4 chunks
			-	Repitition
	Long term
			- 	repition helps store
	
	Spaced Repitition 
			- Repeat over several days

Sleep
	Brain cells shrink to allow flushing
	Too little sleep overtime leads to all sorts of issues
	
	*During sleep - strenghen important concepts
	
	Brain makes connections while sleeping as well
	
	***Review and WANT to dream about it just before sleep***

Sejnowski
	Computational Neurobiology
	Engineering, Science, and Medicine
	
	Learning by doing
	Learning by osmosis
	Keeping engaged during boring lecture - Asking questions
		Active Engagement
	Diffuse Mode - Excercise
		Take notes after diffuse
		
	Context switching, not true multi-tasking
	
	Stimulating Environment and things to doing
	
	***Excercise increases brain activity and neuron development***

	It takes time!!
	
Week 2
	CHUNKS!
	Illusions of Competence
	Overlearning - develop ruts
	Interleaving - variety
	
CHUNKS
	Unite pieces into a whole
	Bits without context doesn't help
	
	Stress decreases ability to create connections
	
	Defense Learning Institue - Languages
	
	Chunk - Mental leaps that unite scatter bits of information through meaning
			- Network of neurons that fire together
	Path to expertise is built in chunks
	
	More than practice and repitition
	
	Chunk - high level concept with details underneath
	
Forming a Chunk
	Broad overview of the Pattern
	Master a chunk over days then knit together
	
	Best chunks are the ones you don't have to think of anymore after mastery
	
	Pay attention to context
	
	Concepts
		Focus on the information
			No phone, email. tv, music 
			Pomodoro
		Understand the basic idea - get the gist
			Take turns - Focused and Diffuse
		
			Understanding how a problem is solved doesn't create a chunk		
		
			Math & science - Close the book and test yourself / try to teach/explain someone else
		
			Understanding is not the same as doing
			
		Context
			Chunks connecting to the bigger picture
			Bottom up learning - Chunking
			Top Down - Context
			
			Top & Bottom up both important
			
			Glance through a topic - "Walkthrough" for context
			
		Practice

Illusions of Competence
	Recall
	Illusions - of competence
	Mini-testing
	Making mistakes
	
 ***Recall - Read and then look away to see how much you remember
		Practice + Recall = faster, better learning
		Retrieval helps form the paths
			Hooks to the subject
		Concept Mapping after chunking
		
		Plain re-reading is only good for refresh after time
		
		*The more you work on chunks, the chunk takes fewer slots in working memory
			slot becomes a hyper link
		
		Practice Recall outside of study space - trying multiple locations
		
		
	Illusions
		Glancing at a soluion and assuming you could get it
		Highlighting can fool you into thinking you got it
		Words or notes that synthesize concepts are better
		
	Mini-Testing pairs with Recall to ensure you're actually learning
		
	Mistakes help fix broken links
	
Bigger Picture
	Movtivation
		Dopamine - reward system in brain
				 - released during unexpected rewards
				 - influence future actions
				 - treat after study uncourages dopamine
		Serotonin	- related to risk taking
		
		Emotions influence learning
	
	Value of a Library of chunks
		Compaction, Transfer, Creativity, Law of Serendipity
		
		Build chunks to create library 
			- Transfer	- concepts in chunks applying to different subjects/contexts
			- Compaction - internalized, embedded deeper
			- Creativity - diffuse connection of chunks
			
		Sequential
			Steps through a processing
			
		Holistic (global) 
			Intuitive insights that should be verified through focus
			
		Law of Serendipity
			Each concept gets easier
		
	Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving
		Overlearning - can be helpful to completely in grain, BUT not during the same session!!
					- use a subsequent session
					- repeat to gain confidence, but can lead to overconfidence
					- Deliberate Practice - Focus sessions on parts you find more difficult
		Einstellung - An inital thought may prevent a better one from being found
					- like a rut
		
		**Interleaving** - jumping back and forth between using or requiring DIFFERNT chunks
					- figure out why diffent problems need different solutions
					- skipping around in the subject, not just the same way all the time
					- switching subjects even helps with total creativity
					- Knowing 1 thing can lead to deep knowledge but deep ruts
					
Chunking Chunking
	Chunks - pieces of information bound by use
			- can get bigger and more complicated
			
	Build chunks
		Focused Attention
		Understanding
		Practice
		Also - Focused & Diffused learning
	
	Recall - Helps chunks
			- Recall in different locations
	Transfer - mastered a chunk in 1 subject applying it to another
	
	Interleaving - mix it up
				build flexibility
				
	Illusions of Competence - Don't fool yourself
				Test yourself
				Don't highlight
				Mistakes are good, learning
				Don't practice the only the easy stuff, practice the hard stuff
